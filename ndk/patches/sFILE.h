 * The following always hold:
 *
 *	if (_flags&(__SLBF|__SWR)) == (__SLBF|__SWR),
 *		_lbfsize is -_bf._size, else _lbfsize is 0
 *	if _flags&__SRD, _w is 0
 *	if _flags&__SWR, _r is 0
 *
 * This ensures that the getc and putc macros (or inline functions) never
 * try to write or read from a file that is in `read' or `write' mode.
 * (Moreover, they can, and do, automatically switch from read mode to
 * write mode, and back, on "r+" and "w+" files.)
 *
 * _lbfsize is used only to make the inline line-buffered output stream
 * code as compact as possible.
 *
 * _ub, _up, and _ur are used when ungetc() pushes back more characters
 * than fit in the current _bf, or when ungetc() pushes back a character
 * that does not match the previous one in _bf.  When this happens,
 * _ub._base becomes non-nil (i.e., a stream has ungetc() data iff
 * _ub._base!=NULL) and _up and _ur save the current values of _p and _r.
 *
 * NOTE: if you change this structure, you also need to update the
 * std() initializer in findfp.c.
